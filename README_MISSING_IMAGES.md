# Missing Image Files

The following image files are referenced in the code but need to be created and added to the repository:

## Album Covers
1. **mp3/vandango/cover.png** - Album cover for "Neurosis" by Skaramush Vandango

These album covers are clickable and should display the album artwork. When clicked, they expand to show the track list.
